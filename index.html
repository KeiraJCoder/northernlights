<h1 class="pageone">Its NOT The Golden Compass</h1>

    <p>This is one of the main things that annoys me about books and TV adaptations, they change the names.
    </p>

    <p>In this example I will discuss why the book series is NOT called The Golden Compass aside from the fact that it isn't a compass</p>

    <p>Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone?<br>Definitely not American enough!. Lets make it Harry Potter and the Sorcerors Stone<br><br></p>
    
    <i>Because everybody knows theres no such thing as Philosophers in America</i>

    <h2>So Who is right?</h2>

    <p>Me, obviously</p>

    <p>For example if my book series were to be re-released in America I would hate if they were to change its name to be more USA</p>

    <strong>Memoirs of a Vampyrs Daughter?</strong>

    <p class="center">More like.....<br>Journal of a Vampires offspring.</p>

    <i >ridiculous</i>

    <h2>So why do they do it?</h2>

    <p>Who knows?</p>

    <p>For example the novel <br><br>"The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle"</p> 
    
    <p id="books">Written by Stuart Turton</p>

    <p>....became<br><br> "The Seven and a Half Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle"</p>

    <p>As a great person once said to me....</p>

    <q>Why seven and a half?</q>
<br><br>
    <strong>Apparently its because Americans die more frequently than British people.......</strong>
<br><br>
    <i>great</i>

    <h2>Yeah but Really....Why?</h2>

    <p>Marketing.....</p>
